* There are more data points in June than in December.
* Logically, minimum temprature in December is much lower than that in June. 
* Standard Deviation in December is greater than that of June, indicating that there is more of a divergence in tempatures during the month of December. 

## Summary

All in all, both June and December temprature didn't seem to have too much of a difference and both are suitable for opening up a surf shop. I also performed two additional queries on precipation data on June and December, respectively.
