The purpose of this project is to use a SQLite database to perform climate analysis using SQLAlchemy.

## Results

As shown in the summary tables below, there are three key differences in weather between June and December.

* There are more data points in June than in December.
* Logically, minimum temperature in December is much lower than that in June. 
* Standard Deviation in December is greater than that of June, indicating that there is more of a divergence in temperature during the month of December. 

## Summary

All in all, both June and December temperature didn't seem to have too much of a difference and both are suitable for opening up a surf shop. I also performed two additional queries on precipitation data on June and December, respectively.

For precipitation:
* There are more data points in June than in December.
* Maximum precipitation in December is higher than June.
* Standard Deviation in December is greater than that of June, indicating that there is more of a divergence in precipitations during the month of December.
